## Redux-Context tutorial React App from Redux to Context API

In this tutorial I intend to create a React demo project using
React and Redux and then transform it to use Context API to 
achieve the same behaviour.

To run the project just clone it. Run `npm install` and then
`npm start`.

The commits will contain an ordered progress of changes made along
the way.

Enjoy.
